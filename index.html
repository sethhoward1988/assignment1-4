                <h1>I'm Colleen.</h1>
                <p>Hi there-</p>

                <p>I'm Colleen (Soon-to-be) Frazer, an adventurer with a quick wit and even quicker problem solving skills. Professionally, I am a dedicated Web Developer, Graphic Designer, and Nature Photographer with an eye for detail and an excellent work ethic. I'm also a self-diagnosed learning addict, which I have finally come to terms with. No need for "12 steps" here.</p> 

                <p>My work typically focus on translating complex concepts into easily digestable interactive websites and visuals - displaying information that a user can understand quickly and interact with easily. I also tend to focuses on purposeful compositions, project-based color schemes, design-enhancing typography, and most of all, ease of use and comprehension for the user, because I firmly believe that if you can't understand what you're looking at, you can't use it, no matter how pretty or cutting-edge it is.</p>

                <h4><em>Fun Fact:</em> In case I've bored you already, perk up my friend, because I've been struck by lightening. That's not boring at all.</h4>
                <p>Now, go click on things. My <a href="resume.html">resume</a> is probably a good place to start.</p>
